# Incremental Implementation Prompt

I need you to implement a specific milestone of a web application based on detailed design specifications and UI components I'm providing.

## Instructions

Please carefully read and analyze the following files:

1. **@product-plan/product-overview.md** — Product summary with sections and data model overview
2. **@product-plan/instructions/incremental/[NN]-[section-id].md** — Implementation instructions for this specific milestone

After reading these, also review:
- **@product-plan/design-system/** — Color and typography tokens (if this is the foundation milestone)
- **@product-plan/data-model/** — Entity types and relationships (if this is the foundation milestone)
- **@product-plan/shell/** — Application shell components (if this is the foundation milestone)
- **@product-plan/sections/[section-id]/** — Section components, types, sample data, and test instructions (for section milestones)

## Before You Begin

Please ask me clarifying questions about:

1. **Authentication & Authorization** (if foundation milestone)
   - How should users sign up and log in?
   - Are there different user roles with different permissions?

2. **Tech Stack Preferences** (if foundation milestone)
   - What backend framework/language should I use?
   - What database do you prefer?

3. **Milestone-Specific Questions**
   - Any specific requirements or constraints for this milestone?
   - Integration points with previous milestones?

4. **Any Other Clarifications**
   - Questions about specific features or user flows
   - Edge cases that need clarification

Once I answer your questions, create an implementation plan for this milestone before coding.
